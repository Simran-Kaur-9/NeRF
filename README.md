# NeRF


[NeRF](http://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf) (Neural Radiance Fields) NeRF is a method for generating novel views of complex scene. It takes
a set of input images of a scene and renders the complete scene by interpolating between the 
scenes.
<br>
The output is a volume whose color and density are dependent on the direction of the camera rays and the emitted light radiance at that point. For each ray we generate an output volume and all these volume make up the complex scene.
